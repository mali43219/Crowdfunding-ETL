# Crowdfunding-ETL

In this module, we assisted Independent Funding in analyzing and organizing data from crowdfunding campaigns. By extracting the backers of active campaigns and gathering their email addresses, Independent Funding was able to reach out to them for additional donations to complete the projects. We employed Jupyter Notebook and Python to generate these lists and utilized PostgreSQL to assemble the data into tables.
